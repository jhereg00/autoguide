# The Problem
## Whose Problem
Developers and designers.
## What Problem
Need a way to both standardize code and keep track of components while maintaining consistent branding/design.
## Why it needs to be solved
As team members come in and out and projects and brands evolve, it's easy to lose track of what does and does not exist, and whether or not it meets guidelines.

# Long Term Goal
**All projects at CE will be built using components/Atomic design, and deliverables will either be or just include a "Tiny Bootstrap"**
## Fail State
Projects Glenn leads will use this or a competitor to describe and document components.

# User Journey Maps
## Developer (Current)
Receive New Project &rarr; Disect Design &rarr; Establish/Choose Framework &rarr; Custom Build Site
## Designer (Current)
Receive New Project &rarr; Design Page/Site &rarr; Get Sign Off &rarr; Send to Dev
## Developer (Target)
Receive New Project &rarr; Design Already Identifies Components &rarr; Creates / Extends Existing Framework with All Components & Brand Elements &rarr; Works With Designer / UX to Assemble Components into Page(s)
## Designer (Target)
Receive New Project &rarr; Design Predicted Components &rarr; Send Components to Dev &rarr; Work with UX to create layouts &rarr; Design Additional Components &rarr; Work With Dev to Implement Components into Page(s)

# Needs to Achieve Goal
* ~~path override~~
* component status
* ~~arbitrary variable documentation (color palettes, sizing, etc.)~~
* styleguide branding overrides
  * colors, fonts, sizing
* **arbitrary templating**
  * **if not defined, system should guess**
* documentation variable, meant for dev-focused information
* arbitrary iframe resizing
* ~~note making/sending?~~: out of scope for now
* search
* nesting as modifier
  `@modifier .emmet.style &`
* ~~arbitrary ordering of components~~
